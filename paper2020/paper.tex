\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The semantics of tense and aspect has been a long standing issue in
the study of formal semantics since the early days of Montague Grammar
and a number of different ideas have been put forth on the table to
deal with them throughout the
years~\citep{dowty:2012,prior:2003,steedman:2000,higginbotham:2009,fernando:2015}. The
semantics of tense and aspect has been also central in the study of
Natural Language Inference (NLI)\todo{citation?}. The various datasets
for NLI that have been proposed by the years contain examples that
have some implicit or explicit reliance on inferences related to tense
and aspect. One of the early datasets used to test logical approaches,
the FraCaS test suite~\citep{cooper:1996} contains a whole section
dedicated to temporal and aspectual inference (section 7). This part
of the FraCaS test suite has been notoriously difficult to tackle. In
fact, all the computational systems ran on the FraCaS test suite so
far skip this section. Additionally, they also skip the anaphora
and ellipsis sections, with the exception of the system presented by
\citet{bernardy_type_2017,bernardy_wide_2019}, which offers a complete whole run of the
FraCaS test suite, excluding the temporal section. In this
paper, we take up the challenge of providing a computationally viable
account of tense and aspect to deal with the notorious section 8\todo{or 7? 8 was not discussed previously} of
the FraCaS test suite. Our account is not meant to be a theoretically
full account of tense and aspect, but rather an account that is driven by the
need to cover the test suite in a way that is general enough to
capture the test suite examples. The account is evaluated on the
entailment properties of various temporal and aspectual examples, as
given by the test suite. As such, we are not getting into the
discussion of how tense and aspect might affect grammaticality or
infelicitousness of various sentences. We take the sentences of the
FraCaS suite to be syntactically correct and the entailment patterns they
are annotated with valid.

The paper is structured as follows: in \cref{sec:background}, we give
a brief summary of the frameworks whose various subsystems rely on. In
particular, the Grammatical Framework is used to construct the
syntactic parser; the Coq proof assistant checks all the reasoning; a
monad-based dynamic semantics deals with references (anaphora).  We
also provide some brief remarks on temporal semantics. In section 3,
we discuss the main aspects of the compositional semantics of our
system \textbf{This could go in the background actually}, and in
section 4, we give our main treatment of time, using various examples
from the FraCaS suite in exemplifying its effectiveness. In section 5,
we take a brief look at how our system performs with respect to the
FraCaS suite. We ran the system across the whole suite, this being the
first time that a complete run through the whole suite has been made,
but we look in particular at the performance on the temporal
section. In section 6, we conclude and discuss avenues for future
work.


%We do not care about classifying sentences as felicitous/infelicitous
%or grammatical/ungrammatical, rather we assume that the sentence is
%correct and care about giving it an appropriate interpretation as a
%logical formula.  Indeed, our evaluation uses entailment properties
%only.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

\paragraph{GF}
The grammatical framework (GF, \citet{Ranta:GF}) is a powerful parser
generator for natural languages, based on type-theoretical abstract grammars.
This work relies a syntactic representation of the FraCaS test suite in GF
abstract syntax~\citep{Ljunglof:2012}. Thus, we skip the parsing phase
and avoid any syntactic ambiguity.

For the purpose of this paper, the important point is that GF the
syntax aims at a balance of sufficient abstraction to provide a
semantically-relevant structure, but at the same time it embeds
sufficiently many syntactic features to be able to reconstruct
unambiguously natural-language text. \cref{ex:nobel}
shows an example abstract syntax tree and its realisation in English.

\paragraph{Coq}
Coq is an interactive theorem prover (proof assistant). It is based on
the calculus of coinductive constructions~\citep{werner_une_1994} We
do not use any coinduction (or even induction) in this paper, relying
on the pure lambda-calculus inner core of Coq.  Coq is a very
powerful reasoning engine that makes it fit for implementing natural
language semantics in it but also, on a more practical side, for the
the task of NLI, when the latter is formalized as a theorem proving
task. Coq supports, as already mentioned, dependent typing, but also
subtyping, which are instrumental in expressing NL semantics.

\paragraph{Montagovian semantics}

Our interpretation is cast within the framework of a largely standard
montagovian semantics. In brief, sentences are interpreted as
propositions, verbs and noun-phrases as predicates.  We use
type-raising of noun-phrases, to support quantifiers~\citep{montague_proper_1974}.

We support additionally the basic constructions and phenomena present
in the testsuite, including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, verbs,
anaphora, etc. We direct the reader to our previous work for details
\ifanon (citations anonymized) \else
\citet{bernardy_type_2017} \fi, but the particular
treatment of such phenomena is essentially independent from our
treatment of time:
in this paper we simply ignore these aspects beyond the fact that they
are handled correctly in most of the cases of the FraCaS testsuite.

\paragraph{Dynamic semantics}
We additionally assume support for (non-temporal) anaphora, using a
monadic-based dynamic semantics
\cite{unger_dynamic_2011,charlow_monadic_2015,charlow_monadic_2017}.
Our particular implementation is not perfect \ifanon (citations
anonymized) \else \citet{bernardy_wide_2019} \fi but non-temporal
anaphoroi in the testsuite are generally resolved as they should be.

As for other basic phenomena, there is not much interaction between
our treatment of time and non-temporal anaphora. One critical
exception is discussed in \cref{sec:repeatable-achievements}.


\paragraph{Temporal Semantics}
\jp{More general intro to temporal semantics? Should this be moved
  somewhere else?}

We use notions of ``stative'', ``achievement'', ``activity''. Our
definition do not seem to match perfectly the definitions found in the
literature; In general, we use the term achievement to include
accomplishment as well. Insofar as the test suite is concerned, we
find that these two categories can be collapsed into a single one.  As
such, we think it is a good classification, given that they generally
afford the correct inferences for the testsuite. (We assume the
testsuite is correct.)


\section{Our Treatment of time}

In montagovian semantics, (intransitive) verbs are one-place
predicates; in types, they are functions from entities to propositions
($e \to t$).  Our basic approach is to generalise the interpretation of 
verbs, so that it takes two
additional time parameters, one corresponding with the starting time
of the action and one corresponding to its stopping time ($(e × time × time) \to t$). For example,
if John walked between $t_0$ and $t_1$, we would have:
$walk(john,t_0,t_1)$. From now on we will call an interval of time
points $[t_0,t_1]$ a timespan. Every timespan $[t_0,t_1]$ has the
property $t_0 ≤ t_1$ (it starts no later than it stops). (We are thus
using a simple newtonian model of time, corresponding to a layman
intuition of a linear constant flow of time.)

In principle, common nouns and adjectives should undergo the same
procedure. For simplicity we will however only consider verbs from now
on. (In fact in our implementation we chose not to modify nouns nor
adjectives to limit the increase in complexity of the formulas.)

\paragraph{temporal context}

We adjust the montagovian semantics so that the interpretation of
every category (propositions, verb phrases, etc.) takes a
\emph{temporal context} as an additional parameter, which serves as a time
reference for the interpretation of all time-dependent semantics
within the phrase.  This context propagates through the compositional
interpretation down to lexical items with atomic representation
(verbs). By default, every interpretation passes the temporal context
down to its components without changing it. However some key elements
will act on it on nontrivial ways, which we proceed to detail below.

This temporal context is an \emph{optional} timespan. That is, it can
be an timespan or an explicitly unspecified context.
\newcommand\nospan{\ensuremath{-}}
\newcommand\anyspan{\ensuremath{\_}}\todo{better notation} The timespan in the context is
optional because, in certain situations, the semantics is different
depending on whether a timespan has been specified externally or not,
as we explain below. A non-present timespan will be represented as
\nospan{}. If a semantic function does not depend on the temporal
context at all, we will write \anyspan{} instead.

\paragraph{tenses}

\newcommand\varid[1]{\mathnormal{#1}}
%
The principal non-trivial manipulator of timespans are tense
markers. In our syntax, inherited from GF, tenses are represented
syntactically as an attribute of the clause. An illustration of a
past-tense clause and its interpretation follows. Notice in particular
the $past$ argument to $useCl$.

\onelingex{A scandinavian won the nobel prize.\label{ex:nobel}
\\
{\small\begin{multline*}
\varid{useCl}\, \varid{past}\, \varid{pPos}\\ (\varid{predVP}\, (\varid{detCN}\, (\varid{detQuant}\, \varid{indefArt}\, \varid{numSg})\\ \varid{scandinavian\_CN})\\ (\varid{complSlash}\, (\varid{slashV2a}\, \varid{win\_V2})\\ (\varid{detCN}\, (\varid{detQuant}\, \varid{indefArt}\, \varid{numSg})\\ \varid{nobel\_prize\_CN})))
\end{multline*}
}}
In our semantics we deal only with present and simple past
tenses. \jp{Is this enough for theory?} Indeed we find that FraCas
does not exercise additional specific tenses (if a more complicated
tense is used, the additional information is also carried by adverbs
or adverbial phrases, in a more specific way.) It is not difficult to see how other tenses can be captured under the same general framework. 

The procedure to handle tense annotations is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item If the tense is the past, and the temporal context is
  unspecified, then we locally quantify over a time interval
  $[t_0,t_1]$, such that $t_1 < now$, where $now$ is a logical
  constant representing the current timepoint. The temporal context
  then becomes this interval.
\item If the tense is the present and the temporal context is
  unspecified, then the temporal context becomes the simple
  $(now,now)$ interval.
\item If the temporal context is specified (for example due to the presence of an adverb or an
  averbial clause, such as ``before James swam''), then the tense does
  not create a new interval, but it may constrain it. Typically, a
  past tense adds the constraint that the temporal context ends before
  the timepoint $now$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{temporal adverbs}

The other single most important source of interesting timespans are
adverbs. Most of the temporal adverbs fall in either of the following
categories:

\begin{enumerate}[align=left,font=\itshape]
\item[exact] For such adverbs, an exact interval is
  provided. Typical such adverbs specify in fact a single point in
  time (so the start and the end of the interval coincide).

  \[⟦\text{at 5 pm, \(s\)}⟧(\anyspan) = ⟦s⟧(5pm,5pm)\]

\item[existentially quantifying] The majority of temporal adverbs
  existentially quantify over a timespan. Examples include ``since
  1991'', ``in 1996'', ``for two years'', etc. The common theme is to
  introduce the interval and then restrict its bounds or its duration
  in some way. Sometimes the restriction is an equality, as in ``for
  exactly two hours''.

  \begin{multline*}
  ⟦\text{in 1992, \(s\)}⟧(\anyspan) = \\ ∃t_1,t_2.  [t_1,t_2] ⊆ 1992, ⟦s⟧(t_1,t_2)
\end{multline*}
In the FraCaS test suite, we normally do not find several
time-modifying adverbs modifying a single verb. Indeed, sentences such
as ``in 1992, in 1991 john wrote a novel'' are infelicitous. This
justifies ignoring the input timespan in the above interpretation --
we're in particular not interested in modeling felicity with our
semantics, only giving an accurate semantics when the input is
felicitous.
\item[universally quantifying] A few adverbs introduce intervals via a
  universal quantification (sometimes with a constraint). Examples
  include ``always'' and ``never''.

  If there is no explicit time context, then ``always'' has no
  constraint on the interval, otherwise the quantified interval must
  be included in it:
  \begin{multline*}
  ⟦\text{always \(s\)}⟧(t_0,t_1) = \\ ∀t_0',t_1'. [t_0',t_1'] ⊆ [t_0,t_1], ⟦s⟧(t_0',t_1')
\end{multline*}
Note that here we \emph{do} use the input interval, resulting in a correct interpretation for
phrases such as ``In 1994, Itel was always on time.'' .

% A specifically interesting case found in FraCas is the adverbial phrase ``every month'', which we modeled
% \begin{equation}
%   ⟦\text{every month s}⟧(t_0,t_1) = ∀t. [t,t+1month] ⊆ [t_0,t_1], ⟦s⟧(t,t+1month)
% \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}


\paragraph{time references and aspectual classes}

A common theme in the testsuite is the reference to previous
occurences of an event:

\fracasex{262}{
\item	Smith left after Jones left.
\item	Jones left after Anderson left.
\hyp 	Did Smith leave after Anderson left?
}

To be able to conclude that there is entailment, as the testsuite expects, we have to make sure
that the two occurences of ``Jones left'' (in \textbf{P1} and \textbf{P2}) refer to the
same time intervals.

For this purpose we postulate \emph{unicity of action} for certain time-dependent
propositions:

\[\constant{unicity}_P : P (t_1,t_2) → P (t_3,t_4) → (t_1 = t_3) ∧ (t_2 = t_4)\]

Unicity of action holds only if the aspectual class of the proposition
$P$ is \emph{achievement} or \emph{actitivty}.\todo{reference in literature}

(The difference between actitivty and achievement is that for the
latter time intervals can be assumed to be of nil duration. In reality, this is an oversimplification as achievements are usually of short duration. but not nil. However, 
this appears to play little role, if any, in our analysis, and given the task-driven nature of it as well.)

Unicity of action appears to be a non-logical principle. Indeed, it is
quite possible that ``Jones left'' several times. However, it seems
that this principle is never contradicted by the testsuite. As such,
even though unicity of action is only a pragmatic rule, it can be
taken as a valid one \emph{by default}: it is only when we have a
sufficiently constrained situation that one should reject it. Consider
the following discourse:
\begin{enumerate}[parsep=0pt,itemsep=1pt,label=(\arabic*)]
\item Smith left at 1pm.
\item Smith went to his appointment with the lawyer.
\item Smith left at 4pm.
\end{enumerate}
One would normally not say that there is contradiction. However if the
middle sentence were not present, a contradiction should be
flagged. We leave such discourse analysis as future work, and simply
apply unicity of action everywhere.

\paragraph{Statives}
\textit{A contrario}, if \(P\) is \emph{stative}, then we get a time-interval subsumption property:

\begin{multline*}
\constant {subsumption}_P :\\ [t_3,t_4] ⊆ [t_1,t_2] → P (t_1,t_2) → P (t_3,t_4)
\end{multline*}
This principle is used to reason about problem (314), below:

\fracasex{314}
{\item	Smith arrived in Paris on the 5th of May, 1995.
\item	Today is the 15th of May, 1995.
\item	She is still in Paris.
\hyp 	Smith was in Paris on the 7th of May, 1995.
}

Indeed, from \textbf{P3} we get that Smith was in paris between May
5th and May 15th. Because "being in Paris" is stative, we also get that
Smith was in Paris in any subinterval. Contrary to unicity of action,
subsumption is always valid.


\paragraph{(un)repeatable achievements}
\label{sec:repeatable-achievements}
The principle of using unicity of action interacts well with the usual
interpretation of quantifiers (and anaphora).  Indeed, using it, we
can refute problem (279), as expected by the testsuite:

\fracasex{279}{
\item	Smith wrote a novel in 1991.
\hyp 	 Smith wrote it in 1992.
}
Indeed, following our account, the above (contradictory) inference problem is to be
interperted as

\[\begin{array}{l}
∃x. novel(x) ∧ \\
∃t_1,t_2. [t_1,t_2] ⊆ 1991 ∧ write(smith,x,t_1,t_2) ∧ \\
∃t_3,t_4. [t_3,t_4] ⊆ 1992 ∧ write(smith,x,t_3,t_4) \\
⟶ ⊥ \\
\end{array}
\]
Note here that the scope for the existential is extended beyond the
scope of \textbf{P1}. This extension can work according to
\citet{unger:2011}, and our implemented analysis of anaphora\ifanon (citation anonymized) \else\citep{bernardy_computational_2018,bernardy_wide_2019}\fi.

Thanks to the unicity of action of $write(smith,x,...)$ we find
\([t_1,t_2] = [t_3,t_4]\), and due to the years 1991 and 1992 being
disjoint we obtain contradiction.

However, the testsuite instructs that we should \emph{not} be able to refute
problem (280), with the justification that ``wrote a novel'' is a repeatable
accomplishment:

\fracasex{280}{
\item	Smith wrote a novel in 1991.
\hyp 	Smith wrote a novel in 1992.
}
Here our interpretation is:

\[\begin{array}{l}
∃x. novel(x) ∧ \\
∃t_1,t_2. [t_1,t_2] ⊆ 1991 ∧ write(smith,x,t_1,t_2) ∧ \\
∃y. novel(y) ∧ \\
∃t_3,t_4. [t_3,t_4] ⊆ 1992 ∧ write(smith,y,t_3,t_4) \\
⟶ ⊥ \\
\end{array}
\]
Our analysis does not need to treat this last case specially. Indeed,
even if $write(smith,x,.,.)$ is an activity \todo{This should be an accomplishment and thus, achievement in our classification} and thus subject to
unicity of action, in (280), $x$ is quantified existentially; we have
two \emph{different} actions: $write(smith,x,t_1,t_2)$ and
$write(smith,y,t_3,t_4)$, because $x \neq y$, and thus we cannot deduce equality of the
intervals $t_1,t_2$ and $t_3,t_4$. In turn, the hypothesis cannot be refuted.

\paragraph{action-modification verbs}

The final class of lexemes carrying a temporal-dependent semantics are
verbs taking a proposition as argument, like ``finish'', ``start'',
etc. These verbs modify the temporal context in non-trivial
ways. Consider for example ``finish to ...''. The timespan of the
argument of ``finish'' should end within the timespan of the finishing
action:

\begin{multline*}
⟦\text{finish to \(s\)}⟧(t_0,t_1) = \\ ∃(t_0',t_1'). t_1' ∈ [t_0,t_1] ∧ ⟦s⟧(t_0',t_1')
\end{multline*}


\section{Results and evaluation}
Our target is the FraCaS testsuite, which aims at covering a wide
range of common natural-language phenomena. The testsuite is structured in 9 sections:


The suite is structured according to the semantic phenomena involved
in the inference process for each example, and contains nine sections:
Quantifiers, Plurals, Anaphora, Ellipsis, Adjectives, Comparatives,
Temporal, Verbs and Attitudes.  The system described here focuses on
the Temporal section. However, it also supports the other eight
sections.  To our knowledge this is the first system which attempt to
target the temporal section. But in fact, our system is even provides
support for all the other section. A couple of decades after its
formulation, we propose a first attempt at covering the whole suite.
As such, there it is no other system to compare our system with, in
all aspects.  We can however compare with systems which target parts
of the FraCaS testsuite, as shown in \cref{tab:results}.

\paragraph{interaction with negation and group readings}
One reason explaining the lower performance of our systems on some
sections of the testsuite is that our interpretation of time interacts
imperfectly with negation and group readings.

The issue is that the quantification introduced by the temporal marker
is outside the negation. For example, the premiss of (038) is
interpreted as ``there exists a time in the past when every delegate
did not finish the report'' --- which is incorrect in this context.
\fracasex{038}{
\item	No delegate finished the report.
\hyp 	Some delegate finished the report on time.
}
%
We stress that such interaction between quantifiers and negation
already occurs without temporal analysis: one must make a difference
between narrow scoping and wide scoping \cite{todo}. Unfortunately,
the montagovian system over which we base our implementation does not
support this phenomena. (In fact the FraCaS test suite does not appear to
test if the difference between narrow and wide scoping is handled properly.)
We propose that the situation becomes
quantitatively more difficult to handle with the added complication of
time-quantification, but not fundamentally different.
%
A similar issue occurs with group readings, which are interpreted as
conjunctions. Here, the problem is to solve the order of scoping
between this conjunction and time-interval quantifiers.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
We have presented a first attempt for a computational approach dealing with the temporal section of the FraCaS test suite. This is the first time a system is ran against this section, at the same time, this concludes our work in handling the whole of the FraCaS test suite using a combination of a number of well-studied tools: type theory, parsing using the Grammatical Framework (GF), Monadic Dynamic Semantics and proof assistant technology (Coq). It achieves an accuracy of 0.71 on the Temporal Section and 0.78 overall. One of the things to be looked at is fixing the issues associated with parts of the test suite that ``broke'' so to say when the temporal analysis was introduced. Some of these have been already mentioned: interaction of the temporal variables with group readings and negation. 

Another issue to be looking at is the codification of lexical aspect. In what we have been doing so far, we did not distinguish between the present continuous and the present or the simple past and the past continuous and their interaction with non-lexical aspect.  The main reason for this  is that in the test suite, even though there are examples of inferences based on the either lexical or non-lexical aspect, no example where an interaction between the two exists. For example, one such case is the one shown below and exemplifies the difference between activities and accomplishments with respect to the different inferences they give when used  in the past continuous:

\fracasex{extra1}{
	\item	John was writing a book. 
	\hyp 	John wrote a book (UNK).
}

\fracasex{extra2}{
	\item	John was running. 
	\hyp 	John ran (YES).
}

\fracasex{extra1}{
	\item	John wrote a book. 
	\hyp 	John was writing a book (YES).
}

\fracasex{extra2}{
	\item	John ran. 
	\hyp 	John was running (YES?).
}

% Things we cannot handle (I think): John was writing a book in 1991 -> John wrote a book in 1991 (I think we predict entailment here). This is because there is no distinction with progressive and non progressive aspect. We did not do it, I guess because it was needed, but just for future reference. There are similar examples playing around with LEXICAL aspect (aspect grammatically encoded) that we could look at in future work
% Accomplishments usually involve a culmination point in the action which is necessary for the event to be completed. This is not necessary for activities. John stopped writing a book not-> John wrote a book (but does imply that John was writing a book), but, John stopped running -> John run and John was runnning
