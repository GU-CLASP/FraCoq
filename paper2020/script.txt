My name is Jean-Philippe Bernardy, and this is joint work with
Stergios Chatzikyriakidis at University of Gothenburg.

This work is an extension of the FraCoq system to support Temporal
Semantics.

The FraCoq system aims at covering the whole test suite invented by
for the FraCaS system. 

We start with abstract syntax trees, and apply a semantic interpretation. This is a montegovian
semantics augmented with dynamic semantics. It yields logical
formula.
We then check if they admit a proof or not, using the Coq proof assistant.

In this paper we add temporal semantics to the system.


<slide 3>

This is done by adding temporal parameters to every propositions. The
temporal information comes from the interpretation of temporal
expressions, as we explain in detail in the paper.
