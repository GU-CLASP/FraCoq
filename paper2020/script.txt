This work is an extension of the FraCoq system that supports Temporal
Semantics.

The FraCoq system aims to cover the whole of the FraCaS test suite. 

We start with abstract syntax trees.
They are interpreted using a montagovian semantics augmented with dynamic semantics.
This yields logical formulas in a type-theory.

We then check if these formulas admit a proof or not, using the Coq proof assistant.

In this paper we add temporal semantics to the system.


<slide 3>

What we do is to add temporal parameters to every proposition.

The temporal information comes from the interpretation of temporal
expressions.
We explain all of this in detail in the paper.
