My name is Jean-Philippe Bernardy, and this is joint work with
Stergios Chatzikyriakidis at University of Gothenburg.

This work is an implementation of Temporal
Semantics.

It is based on FraCoq, which is a our natural language semantics
system.

Our target is the FraCaS test suite.
We start with abstract syntax trees.
Then we interpret them using a montagovian semantics, plus a dynamic semantics.
This gives us logical formulas in a type-theory.
And then we check if these formulas admit a proof or not, using the "Coq" proof assistant.

In this paper we add support for _temporal semantics_ to the system.


<slide 3>

How do we do that? Well you _will_ have to read the paper to find out.

But just to give an idea, and perhaps catch your attention, here are a
couple of examples from the testsuite.
