\title{FraCaS: 80 percent complete}

% - Two-phase system (Dyn semantics from theorem proving)
% - Anaphora (as in Jolli paper) --- but this is the first time that this is done for FraCas.
% - Multiple readings
% - Threshold-based interpretation of (some) adjectives + Linear arithmetic proofs
% - New handling of prepositions and adverbs
% - Definites handled by adding an assumption at the top-level. (instead as inline existential) -- Enabled by dyn. semantics
% - Plurals/Quantifiers improved
% - Genders are properties of nouns
% - Handling of comparatives (with threshold BUT not those of adjectives), relying largely on the dyn. semantic system

  adjectival semantics (division into subsective, extentional,

\subsection{Salient points}
% - Dynamic Semantics/Anaphora (as in Jolli paper) --- but this is the first time that this is done for FraCas.
%   -> Gender is a property of nouns
% - Definites handled by adding an assumption at the top-level. (instead as inline existential) -- Enabled by dyn. semantics
% - Handling of comparatives (with threshold BUT not those of adjectives), relying largely on the dyn. semantic system
% - Threshold-based interpretation of (some) adjectives + Linear arithmetic proofs (Automation)
% - New handling of prepositions and adverbs


\section{Results and evaluation}
% - show overall numbers
% - compare with others
% - error analysis (classify, show examples)
